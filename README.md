# PowerAmit

**PowerAmit** is an AI-powered tool that enables businesses to interact with their datasets using natural language.  
Instead of writing complex queries or code, simply ask questions like:

> "What were the sales in Q1 2024?"  
> "Show me top-performing products by region."

PowerAmit delivers instant, actionable insights—powered by AI.
